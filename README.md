# PrimeNumbers
In this program, we start by printing a message indicating that we will be printing prime numbers from 1 to 100.

Then, we use a loop to iterate through each number from 2 to 100. For each number, we set a boolean variable isPrime to true initially.

Inside the loop, we check if the number is divisible by any number from 2 to number-1. If we find any divisor, we set isPrime to false and break out of the loop.

After checking all possible divisors, if isPrime is still true, it means the number is prime, and we print it.

By the end of the program, all prime numbers from 1 to 100 will be printed on the console.
